# Comprehending Commands 

### making directories 

**Flag:** `pwn.college{kM4fU2y3A7aQagJwmG6hyDOcDPs.QXxMDO0wiN2kjNzEzW}`

First switched to tmp directory then made a directory using mkdir command then created the college file using the touch file.

```
hacker@commands~making-directories:~$ cd /tmp
hacker@commands~making-directories:/tmp$ mkdir pwn
hacker@commands~making-directories:/tmp$ cd /mkdir/pwn
bash: cd: /mkdir/pwn: No such file or directory
hacker@commands~making-directories:/tmp$ ls
bin  hsperfdata_root  pwn  tmp.4mK6TfTSUV
hacker@commands~making-directories:/tmp$ cd pwn
hacker@commands~making-directories:/tmp/pwn$ touch college 
hacker@commands~making-directories:/tmp/pwn$ /challenge/run
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{kM4fU2y3A7aQagJwmG6hyDOcDPs.QXxMDO0wiN2kjNzEzW}
```
