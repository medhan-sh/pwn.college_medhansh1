```
hacker@commands~listing-files:~$ ls /challenge

hacker@commands~listing-files:~$ /challenge/6814-renamed-run-12723

```

## What I learned

1. Intro to ls command. 
2. 'ls' command is used to list files in a directory if used without arguments it would list out files in the current      directory.
