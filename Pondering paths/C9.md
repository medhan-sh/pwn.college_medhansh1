# Pondering Paths 

### home sweet home

**Flag:** `pwn.college{AybX5SZvmv0Uix5rrgBVtM5y012.QXzMDO0wiN2kjNzEzW}`

It was given that the path was supposed to be inside of the home directory with the constraints given the path can be anything as long as its less than three characters
I did go completely wrong with '~/' it was because i was guessing things and trying for the bash to give me additional information 

```
hacker@paths~home-sweet-home:~$ /challenge/run ~/
Writing the file to /home/hacker/!
/challenge/run: line 29: /home/hacker/: Is a directory
... and reading it back to you:
cat: /home/hacker/: Is a directory
hacker@paths~home-sweet-home:~$ /challenge/run ~/a
Writing the file to /home/hacker/a!
... and reading it back to you:
pwn.college{AybX5SZvmv0Uix5rrgBVtM5y012.QXzMDO0wiN2kjNzEzW}
hacker@paths~home-sweet-home:~$ /challenge/run ~/b
Writing the file to /home/hacker/b!
... and reading it back to you:
pwn.college{AybX5SZvmv0Uix5rrgBVtM5y012.QXzMDO0wiN2kjNzEzW}
hacker@paths~home-sweet-home:~$ /challenge/run ~/9
Writing the file to /home/hacker/9!
... and reading it back to you:
pwn.college{AybX5SZvmv0Uix5rrgBVtM5y012.QXzMDO0wiN2kjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

1. Providing Valid arguments to commands .
2. Understanding the '~' shortcut: shorthand for the home directory you are in by default.
