# Pondering Paths

### Position thy self 

**Flag:** `pwn.college{MrMIh4tSImexJT0jloaAnCLn9LZ.QX2QTN0wiN2kjNzEzW}`

I went completely off with 'cd /challenge/run' i thought that in itself was the directory i was supposed to change too. 
I thought of applying 'cd /challenge/run' in the root directory as a sort of trial n error method as it was given it would tell me which directory I was supposed to be in .

```
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:~$ cd /challenge/run
bash: cd: /challenge/run: Not a directory
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:~$ cd /
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/$ /challenge/run
Incorrect...
You are not currently in the /home directory.
Please use the `cd` utility to change directory appropriately.
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/$ cd /home
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/home$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{MrMIh4tSImexJT0jloaAnCLn9LZ.QX2QTN0wiN2kjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

1. Getting used to the cd(change directory) command, cd is the command used for moving directories.
2. You can only cd into directories /challenge/run was a file that's why i wasn't directly able to cd into it 
3. Responding to error messages, error messages gave me the location also told me /challenge/run is not a directory.
