# Pondering Paths

### Implicit relative path 

**Flag:** `pwn.college{4GK_ymlUcllwxvduWp46mBh-SJp.QXxUTN0wiN2kjNzEzW}`

First changed to '/challenge' directory as instructed then used the relative path to execute run .

```
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-path:~$ cd /challenge
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-path:/challenge$ ./run
Correct!!!
./run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{4GK_ymlUcllwxvduWp46mBh-SJp.QXxUTN0wiN2kjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

1. Linux automatically avoids looking in the current directory for naked paths this is because its designed as a          safety measure to prevent accidently executing unwanted programs with the same name in the same directory .
2. Why to use './' instead of the naked path.
