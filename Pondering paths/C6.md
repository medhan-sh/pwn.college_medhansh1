# Pondering Paths 

### implicit relative paths, from /

**Flag:** `pwn.college{0DnpQDXgghoRs_R9ovxAmKH_Id_.QX5QTN0wiN2kjNzEzW}`

The hint and the instructions honestly confused me a little i tried using 'tmp/c' as some examples did. The solve was pretty straightforward as relative path isn't supposed to start with / we first switch to the directory then use the command 'challenge/run' / signified its absolute path inside root directory.

```
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-paths-from-:~$ pwd
/home/hacker
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-paths-from-:~$ cd /
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-paths-from-:/$ /challenge/run
Incorrect...
You invoked this challenge with an absolute path. This challenge needs a relative path!
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-paths-from-:/$ c/challenge/run
bash: c/challenge/run: No such file or directory
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-paths-from-:/$ tmp/c/challenge/run
bash: tmp/c/challenge/run: No such file or directory
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-paths-from-:/$ challenge/run
Correct!!!
challenge/run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{0DnpQDXgghoRs_R9ovxAmKH_Id_.QX5QTN0wiN2kjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

1. Relative path never starts with a /.
2. Relative path is a path that is relative to the directory you are currently inside of.
3. Role of 'cwd'.
