# Pondering Paths 

### explicit relative paths, from /

**Flag:** `pwn.college{U7fkUBZlU1_YUsTgyX4m63DcksP.QXwUTN0wiN2kjNzEzW}`

. reffers to the same directory so i first changed to root directory then ran the program 

```
hacker@paths~explicit-relative-paths-from-:~$ cd /
hacker@paths~explicit-relative-paths-from-:/$ ./challenge/run
Correct!!!
./challenge/run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{U7fkUBZlU1_YUsTgyX4m63DcksP.QXwUTN0wiN2kjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

1. Explicit relative paths start from '.' signifying you current directory '..' signifying the parent directory .
2. Used './' to create an explicit relative path which is different from the naked relative path we learned in the        previous challenge .
