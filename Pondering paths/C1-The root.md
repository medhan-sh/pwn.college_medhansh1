# Pondering Paths

### The roots

**Flag:** `pwn.college{ws6hS2Jh_lei8K2pU-nAe53XbsM.QX4cTO0wiN2kjNzEzW}`

The instruction were pretty straightforward with what was supposed to be done

```
hacker@paths~the-root:~$ /pwn
BOOM!!!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{ws6hS2Jh_lei8K2pU-nAe53XbsM.QX4cTO0wiN2kjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

1. How to run a program using its absolute path .
2. The program was places in root directory represented by '/'.
3. Absolute path is the exact location to a file,command,directory , kind of like GPS coordinates.
