# Terminal Multiplexing 

### Detaching and Attaching (tmux)

**Flag:** `pwn.college{EAxUqQ8Ms_46vmDO1BfDj9Um2Ir.0VO4IDOxwiN2kjNzEzW}`

Very simmilar to challenge 2 used `tmux` commands to create then detach then ran `/challenge/run` to obtain the flag after reattaching.

```
hacker@terminal-multiplexing~detaching-and-attaching-tmux:~$ MSG echo Congratulations, here is your flag: pwn.college{EAxUqQ8Ms_46vmDO1BfDj9Um2Ir.0VO4IDOxwiN2kjNzEzW}
-bash: MSG: command not found
```

## What I learned

1. tmux is related to screen but uses `ctrl+b`.
2. other commands also differ but not a lot of varriations 

## References

NONE
