# Untangling Users 

### Other Users with su 

**Flag:** `pwn.college{IyrUziFhEV7iJHFvlZwPir1w4QV.QX2UDN1wiN2kjNzEzW}`

Follwed the instruction the challenge wanted me to first change to the user `zardus` then run the command `/challenge/run` to obtain the flag. 

```
hacker@users~other-users-with-su:~$ su zardus
Password: 
zardus@users~other-users-with-su:/home/hacker$ /challenge/run 
Congratulations, you have become Zardus! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{IyrUziFhEV7iJHFvlZwPir1w4QV.QX2UDN1wiN2kjNzEzW}
zardus@users~other-users-with-su:/home/hacker$ 
```

## What I learned

1. When `su` is used with no argument it changes to root we need to provide the name of the user as an argument to        change to the specific user.
