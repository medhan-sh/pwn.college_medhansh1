# File Globbing 

### Exclusionary Globbing 

**Flag:** `pwn.college{k4RCAzhKnwW_kaxXQtne3Nk6Mw3.QX2IDO0wiN2kjNzEzW}`

After the changing into `/challenge/files` i listed out the files to check what kind of names do they have my first attempt at globbing went wrong as i forgot to include `*` after `[]` which resulted in only looking for one character files which were none I fixed that and used `[!pwn]*` signifying everything except starting from p,w,n and obtained the flag.

```
hacker@globbing~exclusionary-globbing:~$ cd /challenge/files
hacker@globbing~exclusionary-globbing:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run [!pwn]
Your expansion did not expand to the requested files (amazing beautiful 
challenging delightful educational fantastic great happy incredible jovial kind 
laughing magical optimistic queenly radiant splendid thrilling uplifting 
victorious xenial youthful zesty).
Instead, it expanded to:
[!pwn]
hacker@globbing~exclusionary-globbing:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run [!pwn]*
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{k4RCAzhKnwW_kaxXQtne3Nk6Mw3.QX2IDO0wiN2kjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

1. Using [!__]
2. If we use ! before the keywords inside of [] globbing it omits all the files with the said keywords and outputs        everything else.

## References

NONE
