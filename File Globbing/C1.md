# File Globbing 

### Matching with *

**Flag:** `pwn.college{gAbGkoafr7qpdpoqu7jCWs0N0je.QXxIDO0wiN2kjNzEzW}`

The challenge wanted me to change directories first then run the command to obtain the flag but i can only use less than 4 characters to change into the directories so i used the globbing `*` to cd into `/challenge` and ran the command to obtain the flag. 

```
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /ch*
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ /run
bash: /run: Is a directory
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ /challenge/run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{gAbGkoafr7qpdpoqu7jCWs0N0je.QXxIDO0wiN2kjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

1. Globbing is kind of like a wildcard which the shell uses to match multiple file name's .
2. Basic globbing `*`.
