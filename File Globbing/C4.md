# File Globbing 

### Matching path with []

**Flag:** `pwn.college{IyL9R8zxVQaHl8Taeqz2hX9pd_k.QX0IDO0wiN2kjNzEzW}`

The solve was simmilar to the previous challenge here we instead of changing into the directory we run the command using the absolute path of the path. 

```
hacker@globbing~matching-paths-with-:~$ /challenge/run /challenge/files/file_[absh]
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{IyL9R8zxVQaHl8Taeqz2hX9pd_k.QX0IDO0wiN2kjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
