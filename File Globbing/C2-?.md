# File Globbing 

### Matching with ?

**Flag:** `pwn.college{UXc7mF6IWNpROsTSDbv3F3kw9dF.QXyIDO0wiN2kjNzEzW}`

As `?` is treated as a single operator i used ? equal no. of times as no. of charaters in Challenge to succesfully cd into the correct directory with the given constraints

```
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /?????????
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ /challenge/run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{UXc7mF6IWNpROsTSDbv3F3kw9dF.QXyIDO0wiN2kjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

1. `?` globbing.
2. Shell treats it as a single character so unlike `*` ? will only list out files or directories with the simmilar no.    of characters.
