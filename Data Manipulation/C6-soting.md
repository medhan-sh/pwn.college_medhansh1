# Data Manipulation

### Sorting Data 

**Flag:** `pwn.college{ogVu55XHA3_Dog9Rm2MexMirN13.0FM0MDOxwiN2kjNzEzW}`

Used `sort -r` to sort the data in reverse alphabetical order as it was given that the flag would be last alphabetically.

```
hacker@data~sorting-data:~$ sort -r /challenge/flags.txt
pwn.college{ogVu55XHA3_Dog9Rm2MexMirN13.0FM0MDOxwiN2kjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

1. Sorting data using `sort` command.
2. It can be used in various situations with its different arguments 
    -r: reverse order (Z to A)
    -n: numeric sort (for numbers)
    -u: unique lines only (remove duplicates)
    -R: random order!
