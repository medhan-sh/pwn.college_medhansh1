# Practicing Piping 

### Redirecting Input 

**Flag:** `pwn.college{0V1r3EECkKP8oqPxcpc-NcCf2to.QXwcTN0wiN2kjNzEzW}`

First redirected COLLEGE to PWN then inputed that to the command `/challenge/run` to obtain the flag 

```
hacker@piping~redirecting-input:~$ echo COLLEGE > PWN
hacker@piping~redirecting-input:~$ /challenge/run < PWN
Reading from standard input...
Correct! You have redirected the PWN file into my standard input, and I read 
the value 'COLLEGE' out of it!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{0V1r3EECkKP8oqPxcpc-NcCf2to.QXwcTN0wiN2kjNzEzW}
hacker@piping~redirecting-input:~$ 
```

## What I learned

1. We can redirect the input into a command using `<`.
