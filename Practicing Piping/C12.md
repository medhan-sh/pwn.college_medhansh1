# Practicing Piping

### Writing to multiple Program 

**Flag:** `pwn.college{gL4-BAQwkQIpDOQS6g_6kK_kdpK.QXwgDN1wiN2kjNzEzW}`

Made a typo used < instead of `>` fixed that . The challnge wanted us to redirect ouput of /challenge/hack to both /challenge/the and /challenge/planet simultaneously so used tee with process substitution to gain the flag.  
```
hacker@piping~writing-to-multiple-programs:~$ /challenge/hack | tee >(/challenge/the) >(/challenge/planet)
This secret data must directly and simultaneously make it to /challenge/the and 
/challenge/planet. Don't try to copy-paste it; it changes too fast.
