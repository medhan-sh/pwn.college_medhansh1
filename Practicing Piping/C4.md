# Practicing Pipelines

### Redirecting Errors

**Flag:** `pwn.college{8p7EmBB1VTkOwSkkc2MM71YYwsr.QX3YTN0wiN2kjNzEzW}`

Succesfully redirected the errors and the output for the command `/challenge/run into different files. 
```
hacker@piping~redirecting-errors:~$ /challenge/run > myflag 2> instructions
hacker@piping~redirecting-errors:~$ cat myflag

[FLAG] Here is your flag:
[FLAG] pwn.college{8p7EmBB1VTkOwSkkc2MM71YYwsr.QX3YTN0wiN2kjNzEzW}
```

1. Learned about FD0,FD1,FD2 a command has two outputs standard output and error also known as chatter
2. Redirecting both strings at once.
