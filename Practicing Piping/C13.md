# Practice Piping 

### Split piping stderr and stdout

**Flag:** `pwn.college{wdAIdMYflr9v1JaBSBMHdh5hvXt.QXxQDM2wiN2kjNzEzW}`

Tried playing around with `&` didn't work. From reading the instruction I knew we cannont use | as it will not give stderr in any case so had to use `>` tried it with `&` in whatever way it made sense to me didn't work as i think i used error first i maybe wrong. 
```
hacker@piping~split-piping-stderr-and-stdout:~$ /challenge/hack 2>&1 >(/challenge/the) 1>&1 >(/challenge/planet)
It looks like you passed something like '>(something)' as an *argument* to 
/challenge/hack rather than redirecting /challenge/hack's out/error to 
'>(something)'. Remember, 'cmd1 >(cmd2)' does *NOT* redirect output of cmd1; 
rather, it'll run cmd2, hook a file up to its standard input, and pass that 
file as an argument to cmd1. If you want to redirect cmd1's output into that 
file, you will need to do: 'cmd1 > >(cmd2)', which is equivalent to 'cmd1 | 
cmd2'.
You must redirect my standard output into '/challenge/planet'!
You must redirect my standard error into '/challenge/the'!
bash: /dev/fd/63: Permission denied
Are you sure you're properly redirecting /challenge/hack's standard error into 
'/challenge/the'?
Are you sure you're properly redirecting /challenge/hack's standard output into 
'/challenge/planet'?
```
Fixed it by going over some iterations 
```
hacker@piping~split-piping-stderr-and-stdout:~$ /challenge/hack > >(/challenge/planet) 2> >(/challenge/the)
Congratulations, you have learned a redirection technique that even experts 
struggle with! Here is your flag:
