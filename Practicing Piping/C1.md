# Practicing Piping 

### Redirecting Output 

**Flag:** `pwn.college{4X4n5J7i4mAj3-yaBwBP-2V7dHt.QX0YTN0wiN2kjNzEzW}`

First used `echo` commannd to get the output PWN then used `>` to redirect the strinf into COLLEGE file. 

```
hacker@piping~redirecting-output:~$ echo PWN > COLLEGE
Correct! You successfully redirected 'PWN' to the file 'COLLEGE'! Here is your 
flag:
pwn.college{4X4n5J7i4mAj3-yaBwBP-2V7dHt.QX0YTN0wiN2kjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

1. Redirecting using `>`.
2. echo command simply repeats whatever i give it to say.
