# Practicing Piping 

### Named pipes 

**Flag:** `pwn.college{EkA-KaKFhRMQP_ZAjVHdGqe8UT8.01MzMDOxwiN2kjNzEzW}`

After making the FIFO file i opened another terminal to redirct /challenge/run to /tmp/flag_file to create an input for the fifo file then on the original terminal used cat to obtain the flag .
there were a lot of typo's

```
hacker@piping~named-pipes:~$ mkfifo /tmp/flag_fifo
hacker@piping~named-pipes:~$ cat /tmp/flag_fifo >
bash: syntax error near unexpected token `newline'
hacker@piping~named-pipes:~$ /tmp/flag_fifo
bash: /tmp/flag_fifo: Permission denied
hacker@piping~named-pipes:~$ cat /tmp/flag_fifo
You've correctly redirected /challenge/run's stdout to a FIFO at 
/tmp/flag_fifo! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{EkA-KaKFhRMQP_ZAjVHdGqe8UT8.01MzMDOxwiN2kjNzEzW}
hacker@piping~named-pipes:~$ 

hacker@piping~named-pipes:~$ /challenge/run > /tmp/flag_fifo
You're successfully redirecting /challenge/run to a FIFO at /tmp/flag_fifo! 
Bash will now try to open the FIFO for writing, to pass it as the stdout of 
/challenge/run. Recall that operations on FIFOs will *block* until both the 
read side and the write side is open, so /challenge/run will not actually be 
launched until you start reading from the FIFO!

```

## What I learned

1. Making a FIFO  using `mkfio`.
2. A Fifo file neds both of its end engaged to generate an output .
3. They are used simmilar to any file.
4. FIFOs are useful for facilitating complex data flows, merging and splitting data in flexible ways, and so on.
