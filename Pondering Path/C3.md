# Pondering Paths 

### Finding Commands

**Flag:** `pwn.college{wfAVeTQrfqNsMbLgVKhT1VENrJI.01NzEzNxwiN2kjNzEzW}`

After Finding out win commands using `which` I read the file which gave me the hint to hwo to obtain the flag I read the file `/challenge/paths/17414/flag` to obtain the flag 
```
hacker@path~finding-commands:~$ which win 
/challenge/paths/17414/win
hacker@path~finding-commands:~$ cat /challenge/paths/17414/win
#!/bin/bash

/bin/fold -s <<< "Search for the flag in the same directory in which I am located!"
hacker@path~finding-commands:~$ cat /challenge/paths/17414/flag
pwn.college{wfAVeTQrfqNsMbLgVKhT1VENrJI.01NzEzNxwiN2kjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

1. `which` looks at each directory in `$PATH` in order and prints the first file it finds whose name matches the argument you passed.
