# Pondering Paths 

### SETTING PATH 

**Flag:** `pwn.college{YU4ez3dvpCbcKE-vfIMJJkoyogQ.QX1cjM1wiN2kjNzEzW}`

SInce the path was inside `/challenge/more_commands/ ` I changed the PATH to it to obtain the flag .
```
hacker@path~setting-path:~$ PATH=/challenge/more_commands/
hacker@path~setting-path:~$ /challenge/run 
Invoking 'win'....
Congratulations! You properly set the flag and 'win' has launched!
pwn.college{YU4ez3dvpCbcKE-vfIMJJkoyogQ.QX1cjM1wiN2kjNzEzW}
```
