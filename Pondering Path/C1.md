# Pondering Paths 

### The PATH varriable 

**Flag:** `pwn.college{IaRvL8qmtXvL5-YT202pg1IBWNb.QX2cDM1wiN2kjNzEzW}`

I changed the current value of path to nothing which will disallow access to rm command using `PATH=""`.
```
hacker@path~the-path-variable:~$ PATH=""
hacker@path~the-path-variable:~$ /challenge/run 
Trying to remove /flag...
/challenge/run: line 4: rm: No such file or directory
The flag is still there! I might as well give it to you!
pwn.college{IaRvL8qmtXvL5-YT202pg1IBWNb.QX2cDM1wiN2kjNzEzW}
```
