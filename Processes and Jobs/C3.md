### Interupting Processes

**Flag:** `pwn.college{QHaBVXbVqa54iOfcon0Wf7kl67u.QXzQDO0wiN2kjNzEzW}`

After running the command `/challenge/run` interupted it with ctrl+c to interupt it to obtain the flag.

```
hacker@processes~interrupting-processes:~$ /challenge/run 
I could give you the flag... but I won't, until this process exits. Remember, 
you can force me to exit with Ctrl-C. Try it now!
^C
Good job! You have used Ctrl-C to interrupt this process! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{QHaBVXbVqa54iOfcon0Wf7kl67u.QXzQDO0wiN2kjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
