# Processs and Jobs 

### Starting Background Processes 

**Flag:** `pwn.college{ICcAtN7rh6AlM9SX9Plt0o5_I4b.QX5QDO0wiN2kjNzEzW}`

Used `&` to start the process `/challenge/run` in the background as instructed. 

```
hacker@processes~starting-backgrounded-processes:~$ /challenge/run &
[1] 147
hacker@processes~starting-backgrounded-processes:~$ 


Yay, you started me in the background! Because of that, this text will probably 
overlap weirdly with the shell prompt, but you're used to that by now...

Anyways! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{ICcAtN7rh6AlM9SX9Plt0o5_I4b.QX5QDO0wiN2kjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

1. `&` argument starts the prpcess directly in the background without neding to suspedn it first.
