# Shell Varriable 

### Setting Varriable 

**Flag:** `pwn.college{sGOBYKpJaWXtQIVsP1LJ9_r95cP.QX5UTN0wiN2kjNzEzW}`

Set up the value of the varriable as instructed. 

```
hacker@variables~setting-variables:~$ PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{sGOBYKpJaWXtQIVsP1LJ9_r95cP.QX5UTN0wiN2kjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

1. How to assign a value to a varriable.
2. $ is only used prepending the variable when the shell has to access the varriable.
