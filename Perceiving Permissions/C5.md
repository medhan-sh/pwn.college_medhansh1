# Perceiving Permissions 

### Executable Files

**Flag:** `pwn.college{Adw181IIeJB8L8eaIlQDb6ffncp.QXyEjN0wiN2kjNzEzW}`

After reading the permissions for `/challenge/run` I found out that no one had the access to execute the command so i changed the permissions making it executable for everyone using `chmod ugo+x` then executed the command to obtain the file. 

```
hacker@permissions~executable-files:~$ ls -l /challenge/run 
-r--r--r-- 1 hacker hacker 32 Jan 14  2025 /challenge/run
hacker@permissions~executable-files:~$ chmod ugo+x /challenge/run 
hacker@permissions~executable-files:~$ /challenge/run 
Successful execution! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{Adw181IIeJB8L8eaIlQDb6ffncp.QXyEjN0wiN2kjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

1. The system checks the owner permission first from my attempts at this question i learnd that if the file is not        executable for the owner the file wont be executable for others.
