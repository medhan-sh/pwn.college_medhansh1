# Perceiving Permissions 

### Permission setting Practice

**Flag:** `pwn.college{s-D2Kos6smzzU9fb8hA0oaxtD6O.QXzETO0wiN2kjNzEzW}`

Simmilar to the last challenge but instead of adding we were overwritting permissions over the previous one's.

```
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$ chmod u=r,o=w /challenge/pwn 
You set the correct permissions!
Round 8 of 8!

Current permissions of "/challenge/pwn": r--r---w-
* the user does have read permissions
- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
* the group does have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
- the world doesn't have read permissions
* the world does have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions

Needed permissions of "/challenge/pwn": -w-----w-
- the user doesn't have read permissions
* the user does have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
- the world doesn't have read permissions
* the world does have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$ chmod u=w,g=- /challenge/pwn 
You set the correct permissions!
You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

Current permissions of "/flag": ---------
- the user doesn't have read permissions
- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
- the world doesn't have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$ chmod uo+rwx
chmod: missing operand after ‘uo+rwx’
Try 'chmod --help' for more information.
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$ chmod uo+rwx /flag
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{s-D2Kos6smzzU9fb8hA0oaxtD6O.QXzETO0wiN2kjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

1. The `chmod` commad can also be used to overwrite permissions using the `=` instead of `+`,`-`
2. Multiple permissions can be changed at once bu using `,`.
