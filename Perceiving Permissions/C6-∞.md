# Perceiving Permissions 

### Permission Tweaking Practice

**Flag:** `pwn.college{I3aVTRk5E2ZBIBaBWBkM-mOxV3w.QXwEjN0wiN2kjNzEzW}`

The challenge wanted me to go through 8 rounds of changing permissions to desired outcomes after which it gave the permissions to the flag i changed the permissions of the flag using `chmod uo+rwx` giving me access to the file which I read to obtain the flag. 

```
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ chmod g+w /challenge/pwn 
You set the correct permissions!
You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

Current permissions of "/flag": ---------
- the user doesn't have read permissions
- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
- the world doesn't have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ chmod uo+rwx /flag
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{I3aVTRk5E2ZBIBaBWBkM-mOxV3w.QXwEjN0wiN2kjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

1. Using `chmod` to give specific permissions and reading permissions correctly.
