# Perceiving Permissions 

### Fun with Group names

**Flag:** `pwn.college{gyyP3cgNqfk2bhQRqhP17BaL_OC.QXycjM1wiN2kjNzEzW}`

First Used `ls -l /` to find the flag file inside grp then used `id` to find the group name i was currently inside of then changed the group of the flag to `grp16452` to give myself group access to the file then read the file. 
```
hacker@permissions~fun-with-groups-names:~$ id
uid=1000(hacker) gid=1000(grp16452) groups=1000(grp16452)
hacker@permissions~fun-with-groups-names:~$ chgrp grp16452 flag
hacker@permissions~fun-with-groups-names:~$ cat flag
pwn.college{gyyP3cgNqfk2bhQRqhP17BaL_OC.QXycjM1wiN2kjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

1. Although having the same name for user and group may be a convention for linux but mught not be the case everytime.
2. In these cases `id` can be used to identify the correct the correct Group name.
