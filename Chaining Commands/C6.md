### Executable Shell Scripts 

**Flag:** `pwn.college{ALhxLw999udhuTmg2y6_0Pz0oHp.QX0cjM1wiN2kjNzEzW}`

After creating the required script I changed its permissions using `chmod uo+x` to make it executable then executed it to obtain the flag.

```
hacker@chaining~executable-shell-scripts:~$ echo /challenge/solve > x.sh 
hacker@chaining~executable-shell-scripts:~$ ls -l x.sh 
-rwxr--r-x 1 hacker hacker 17 Oct 10 17:15 x.sh
hacker@chaining~executable-shell-scripts:~$ ./x.sh 
Congratulations on your shell script execution! Your flag:
pwn.college{ALhxLw999udhuTmg2y6_0Pz0oHp.QX0cjM1wiN2kjNzEzW}
```
