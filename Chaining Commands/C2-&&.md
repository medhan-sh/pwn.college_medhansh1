# Chaining Commands

### Building on Success

**Flag:** `pwn.college{helloworld}`

First used both the commands seperatily nothing worked then used `&&` to chain th two commands to obtain the flag.

```
hacker@chaining~building-on-success:~$ /challenge/first-success
hacker@chaining~building-on-success:~$ /challenge/second 
Error: /challenge/first-success must be successfully chained with 
/challenge/second using &&
hacker@chaining~building-on-success:~$ /challenge/first-success && /challenge/secong
bash: /challenge/secong: No such file or directory
hacker@chaining~building-on-success:~$ /challenge/first-success && /challenge/second
Nice chaining! Flag: pwn.college{QSlBfbHm2uIcNlciRHq1BGQR-q8.0lM0MDOxwiN2kjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

1. `&&` chains command in succession the second command would only work if the first succeded.
