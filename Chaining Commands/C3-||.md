# Chaining Commands

### Handling Failure 

**Flag:** `pwn.college{cbvN0DChqyW5mqzq0fRK7EjhY-x.01M0MDOxwiN2kjNzEzW}`

Used the OR operator `||` to chain the commands.
```
hacker@chaining~handling-failure:~$ /challenge/first-failure || /challenge/second
Nice chaining! Flag: pwn.college{cbvN0DChqyW5mqzq0fRK7EjhY-x.01M0MDOxwiN2kjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

1. Unlike the AND operator the OR `||` operator only executes the second command if the first command fails.
